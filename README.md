# Portfolio-Website
My portfolio website is a showcase of my skills, experiences, and projects. It serves as a personal branding platform and a professional online presence. The design of the website is clean, modern, and user-friendly, reflecting my personality and style.

# Homepage :
The homepage welcomes visitors with an eye-catching banner featuring my name and a concise tagline that highlights my expertise or passion. It provides a brief introduction, conveying my mission and what I have to offer. Navigation is intuitive, allowing visitors to easily explore different sections of the website.

# Project :
The central focus of the website is the "Portfolio" section, where I showcase a selection of my best work. I organize the projects into categories, making it easy for visitors to navigate and find specific types of work. Each project entry includes a brief description, images, videos (if applicable), and links to live demos or repositories.
